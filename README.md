## Usage

Using URLBuilder is really simple. You can access an API like this:

```swift
let url = URLBuilder
    .scheme(.https)
    .user(custom: "john.doe")
    .host(custom: "www.example.com")
    .port(custom: 123)
    .path(custom: "/forum/questions")
    .query(items: ("tag", "networking"), ("order", "order"))
    .fragment(custom: "top")
    .url

print(url ?? "nil") // https://john.doe@www.example.com:123/forum/questions?tag=networking&order=order#top
```

This is a very simple example. Don't do that ðŸ˜„
